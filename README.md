# cbwizard_STM32F401
Codeblocks wizard for adding environment of STM32F401 to create default STM32 projects
test-project can be used as base-project for development the software of STM32F401RE.
There are some my specific HAL invokes, but you can regenerate it STMCubeMX and replace.

Next step of my discovery is to add some compilation options/orders into wizard.script.
Right now these options are presented in test.cbp.
Do not keep your mind on the codeblocks directory - it's a try to create STM32F401RE default compiler description.
